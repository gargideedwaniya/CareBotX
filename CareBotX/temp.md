INFO:__main__:Processed response from llama11b API : The figure shows the neural net architecture of a transformer. The encoders are the N-Head self attention blocks. There are two lines in this diagram: N is the number of attention heads, and X is the number of layers. This neural net learns this through transformer learning, most commonly an attention weighted multiplication with matrix multiplication and some addition functions.

I hope this helps clarify what the image means for neural net transformers. The more transformer type neural nets become the more basic concepts like addition and multiplication are used to make the operations happen.       

If you would like further clarification or another explanation of what this neural net can process and interpret, please let me know.
INFO:__main__:Processed response from llama90b API : The encoders in the image are two separate components: the Encoder and the NX Encoder. Each of these encoders is further divided into sub-components, including:

*   **Encoder:**
    *   ADD & NORM
    *   Feed Forward
    *   MULTI-HEAD ATTENTION
    *   MULTI-HEAD ATTENTION
*   **NX Encoder:**
    *   ADD & NORM
    *   Feed Forward
    *   MULTI-HEAD ATTENTION
    *   MASKED MULTI-HEAD ATTENTION

These sub-components are represented as blocks within the main encoder blocks, with arrows indicating the flow of information between them. The presence of these sub-components suggests that the encoders are designed to perform complex operations on the input data, such as attention mechanisms and multi-head attention.
